# Pokédex

This is a portfolio project and is intended to demonstrate development skills.

This project is a web-based Pokédex based on [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). It shows a list of Pokémon, which can be catched or released. Caught Pokémon are listed in the Pokédex page. Clicking in a Pokémon shows its information, like stats, variations and their evolution chain. The Pokédex features:

- Infinite loading
- Animations
- Page transitions
- Responsiveness
- Dark mode
- Server-side rendering

The application is built on Typescript using React.js/Next.js as UI framework. TailwindCSS is used as styling tool.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app.
